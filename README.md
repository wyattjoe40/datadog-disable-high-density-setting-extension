## Description

An extension that automatically disables the high-density setting on DataDog Dashboards.

DataDog thinks that because I have a large monitor then I must want the "Increase density on wide screens" option enabled. And DataDog thinks it isn't worth creating a global setting for "Increase density on wide screens" so that I can avoid disabling the setting every time I view a dashboard. Well, DataDog is wrong.

This extension automatically disables the "Increase density on wide screens" option every time you view a DD dashboard.

P.S. DataDog I love you, your product's great.
